# Portfolio Template

**Description**  
This is my first web development project — a clean, modern, and responsive portfolio template built from scratch. I used only **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to create a fully functional layout showcasing personal information, skills, and projects. This project helped me strengthen my understanding of front-end development and responsive design.

## Tools & Technologies Used

The project was built using basic front-end technologies to practice core web development skills without relying on frameworks or libraries:

- ![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/HTML5-E34F26?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white) **HTML** – Structured the content and sections of the portfolio using semantic tags for better accessibility and organization.  
- ![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/CSS3-1572B6?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white) **CSS** – Styled the website, implemented layouts, typography, colors, responsive design, and simple animations for a modern look.  
- ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-F7DF1E?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=black) **JavaScript** – Added interactivity, including navigation behavior, scroll effects, and dynamic content interactions.
